This is essentially a proof-of-concept repository to show how we could use GitHub plus something like jsdelivr to create an inexpensive CDN for code that's not full of critical intellectual property.

For example, you can access this repo's utils.js file at the following URL:

[https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/openHawkes/utils@latest/utils.min.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/openHawkes/utils@latest/utils.min.js)

... or unminified at... 

[https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/openHawkes/utils@latest/utils.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/openHawkes/utils@latest/utils.js)

Nearly zero overhead. Neat, huh?
